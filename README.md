**A great place for sharing quotes! (maybe?)**

This small web app initially created in 2022 as a way for me to get to know frontend web frameworks like React and Vue, and updated in 2025 with newer libraries and packages.

The original code from 2022 can be found in the `old` branch.

Builds are online and can be found at <https://cockatoo-dev.github.io/quotemaster/>
