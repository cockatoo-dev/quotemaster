# quotemaster

A great place for sharing quotes! (maybe?)

This small web app was created as a way for me to get to know frontend web frameworks. It was built twice using two different popular frameworks.

Choose one of the builds below (they are functionally identical)
- [Vue build](https://max8539.github.io/quotemaster/build-vue/#)
- [React build](https://max8539.github.io/quotemaster/build-react/#)
