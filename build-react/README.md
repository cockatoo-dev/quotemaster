# Quotemaster - React build

**A great place for sharing quotes! (maybe?)**

This small web app was created as a way for me to get to know frontend web frameworks like React and Vue.

The code in this repository is only a frontend for Quotemaster. Quotemaster also makes use of a backend API which can be found [here](https://github.com/cockatoo-dev/quotemaster-api).

The React build of Quotemaster is currently being hosted online at <https://cockatoo-dev.github.io/quotemaster/build-react/#>
